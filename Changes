  - Fix Catalyst::Controller::SimpleCAS adaptor to accept 'simplecas' attribute
  - Standardize on 'cas' attribute for sub-objects:
    - VirtualHandle attribute '_cas' => 'cas'
    - File attribute 'store' => 'cas'
    (but keep old names as aliases, for back-compat)
  - Avoid undef exceptions during global destruction if cas object gets freed
    before sub-objects.

0.03 - 2022-11-06
  - DataStore::CAS:
     - New API methods ->calculate_hash and ->calculate_file_hash
     - During all ->put methods, calculate the hash first before writing a stream,
       (if the source is a scalar or a file) to avoid unnecessary writes.
     - Allow scalar-refs to be passed to ->put_scalar to avoid copying large scalars.
     - Do not inspect is_utf8 flag during ->put_scalar.  Require caller to provide
       bytes, and die if given a character > 255.
     - New ->put_file option { move => 1 }, renames the source file into the CAS
       unlinking the original even if it was a duplicate.
  - DataStore::CAS::Simple:
     - New option '=' as last element of ->fanout causes content files to be named
        with the full hash as the filename, instead of the remainder of the hash that
        wasn't part of the directories.
     - Remove attribute _fanout_regex which never should have been documented
        as if it were public.
     - New methods ->path_parts_for_hash and ->path_for_hash
     - Raise the limits on max directory fanout
